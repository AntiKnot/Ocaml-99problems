# Ocaml99
99 Problems (solved) in OCaml           
*All solutions are in a single file*
## tips
I did not use signatures in the exercises. In some progressive exercises, I often modify and refactor a lot.

# test
```bash
opam install ounit
```

## linked
- [x] like Ruby-koans. Design test cases for others who use 99 Problems and learn ocaml.


## run testcase
Used true/false describe pass/not. 
```bash
dune build
dune ./_build/default/Ocaml99.exe  
```
